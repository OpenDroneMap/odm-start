Easy to use computer vision software for civilian drones and more.

Download and install VirtualBox, Vagrant, and MeshLab

* VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/
* Vagrant: http://www.vagrantup.com/
* http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/Â­

---

If you are a Windows user, please also install Putty and github for windows:

* http://tartarus.org/%7Esimon/putty-snapshots/x86/putty-installer.exe
* https://windows.github.com/

If a Mac user, install github for Mac:

* https://mac.github.com/

---

Now clone the Vagrant machine repository, and start up:

```SHELL
git clone https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/odm.git
cd odm
vagrant up
vagrant ssh 
```
(for Windows users-- run this in your Git Shell)

---

otherwise
```SHELL
cd
git clone https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/BundlerTools.git
```

This will take a while-- it's a 500MB repo...

```SHELL
cd ~/BundlerTools
./install.sh
```

---

Let's run a test dataset.

```SHELL
cd ~/BundlerTools/src/bundler/examples/kermit
~/BundlerTools/./run.pl
```

---

Go get a cup of coffee.

Once complete, we should have some extra directories created. Since we specified no parameters, we get the following by default:

```
reconstruction-with-image-size-1200
reconstruction-with-image-size-1200-results
```

---

To view, we open MeshLab on our host machine. These will be in our original odm directory, e.g.

odm/BundlerTools/src/bundler/examples/kermit/reconstruction-with-image-size-1200-results/option-0000.ply

---

Open MeshLab, choose File:Import Mesh 
and navigate to the directory and choose option-0000.ply

---

To halt vm:
```
exit
vagrant halt

```

---

Photos:

Use a simple point and shoot.
GoPro is a maybe (wide angle could be a problem)
Take lots of overlapping photos.
